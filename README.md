# ConPanion
A convention-planning app with a focus on cosplayers and costumers. In this app, a user can make a list of conventions theyâ€™re attending, create costume pages, and participate in groups. For each convention, the user can add their planned costumes, manage packing lists, and create a lineup/calendar. They can create and join groups, where they can chat with other group members.
